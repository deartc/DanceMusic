# DanceMusicProject
This is a  project named DanceMusic.  I teach dance exercise classes and  I would like to have better organization for my music collection, student dance preferences,  and contact information.  Although those are my ultimate goals,  I had to limit my class project to just using tables accessed possibly by Spotify type program due to time constraints and specific class requirenments.  I plan on expanding it later after the course ends.  
I used Window and SQL Express.   To run my project your must do the following: Go to github.com/deartc/DanceMusic.  Clone the repository.  Open in Sql compatabile program ( only tested with SQL Express).  


I satsified the requirements by doing the following:

Created a relational database schema with a minimum of 3 tables.

Created DDL (Data Definition Language) for tables and views. At least 2 of the tables  contain 4 or more columns.

Two of the tables  have a many-to-many relationship.


Two of the tables  have a one-to-many relationship.


The following data types are present somewhere in the table definitions: DATETIME, INT, VARCHAR


Each table is related to one or more of the other tables via a primary key/foreign key relationship.

To complete the requirements I did the following:

Loaded data into the database schema


Created DML (Data Manipulation Language) to load the tables with sample data.


Populated these tables with data by manually inserting data, or using some sort of import tool.  I have included input script. 


Created and called at least 4 stored procedures.
 




Created stored procedures to expose CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality.


Chose at least 1 item from each group on the Features List below and implemented them in my stored procedures or DDL script:


Group 1 Used: Reading Data from a Database
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a JOIN.



Group 1  not used:
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a JOIN with 3 or more tables.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a LEFT JOIN.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a variable in the WHERE clause.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes an ORDER BY clause.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a GROUP BY clause along with an aggregate function.
Write a SELECT query that utilizes a CALCULATED FIELD.
Write a SELECT query that utilizes a SUBQUERY.
Write a SELECT query that utilizes a JOIN, at least 2 OPERATORS (AND, OR, =, IN, BETWEEN, ETC) AND A GROUP BY clause with an aggregate function.
Write a SELECT query that utilizes a JOIN with 3 or more tables, at 2 OPERATORS (AND, OR, =, IN, BETWEEN, ETC), a GROUP BY clause with an aggregate function, and a HAVING clause.
Write a SELECT query that uses a WHERE clause.
Write a  SELECT query that uses an OR and an AND operator.
Write a  SELECT query that filters NULL rows using IS NOT NULL.







Group 2: Updating / Deleting Data from a Database  I used the following one to satisfy requiremnts:

  I used the write a DML statement that UPDATEs a set of rows with a WHERE clause. The values used in the WHERE clause should be a variable.


UPDATE album
SET country = 'USA'
WHERE country= 'Great Britain';


I did not use these group 2 features:
Write a a DML statement that DELETEs a set of rows with a WHERE clause. The values used in the WHERE clause should be a variable.
Write a DML statement that DELETEs rows from a table that another table references. This script will have to also DELETE any records that reference these rows. Both of the DELETE statements need to be wrapped in a single TRANSACTION.


Group 3: Optimizing a Database

I included the following third feature:   Design a NONCLUSTERED INDEX with ONE KEY COLUMN that improves the performance of one of the above queries.

UPDATE music AS m
SET albumID = (SELECT albumID FROM albumList AS a WHERE m.songalbum = a.album) 
WHERE albumID IS NULL
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM albumList AS a WHERE m.songalbum = a.album) ; 



I did not include the folowing third features:
Design a NONCLUSTERED INDEX with TWO KEY COLUMNS that improves the performance of one of the above queries.
Design a NONCLUSTERED INDEX with AT LEAST ONE KEY COLUMN and AT LEAST ONE INCLUDED COLUMN that improves the performance of one of the above queries.


Correct use of Git/Github and commits: I followed the correct steps in the project guidelines to create and name the github repository that would reflect a distinct repository. I then used the proper guidelines to initialize the project and add files using git bash and the command line. I then far exceeded the minimum number of commits needed to pass.

I also named my file a distinct name describing my project.
