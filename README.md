# DanceMusicProject
This is a  project named DanceMusic, The Dance Muisc Database holds information about a music directory.  I am using Windows.   To access the relevant information  do the following:


I satsified the requirement by doing the following:

Created a relational database schema with a minimum of 3 tables.
Created DDL (Data Definition Language) for tables and views.
At least 2 of the tables should contain 4 or more columns.
Two of the tables should have a many-to-many relationship.
Two of the tables should have a one-to-many relationship.
The following data types should be present somewhere in the table definitions: DATETIME, INT, VARCHAR
Each table should be related to one or more of the other tables via a primary key/foreign key relationship.

Loaded data into the database schema
Created DML (Data Manipulation Language) to load the tables with sample data.
Populated these tables with data by manually inserting data, or using some sort of import tool. INCLUDE YOUR INSERT SCRIPT. If you need help generating an insert script for a table that has a lot of data in it, please let a mentor know.

Created and called at least 4 stored procedures.
Created stored procedures to expose CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality.

Chose at least 1 item from each group on the Features List below and implemented them in your stored procedures or DDL script

.
FEATURE LIST:
Using the above tables...
Group 1: Reading Data from a Database
Write a SELECT query that uses a WHERE clause.
Write a  SELECT query that uses an OR and an AND operator.
Write a  SELECT query that filters NULL rows using IS NOT NULL.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a JOIN.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a JOIN with 3 or more tables.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a LEFT JOIN.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a variable in the WHERE clause.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes an ORDER BY clause.
Write a  SELECT query that utilizes a GROUP BY clause along with an aggregate function.
Write a SELECT query that utilizes a CALCULATED FIELD.
Write a SELECT query that utilizes a SUBQUERY.
Write a SELECT query that utilizes a JOIN, at least 2 OPERATORS (AND, OR, =, IN, BETWEEN, ETC) AND A GROUP BY clause with an aggregate function.
Write a SELECT query that utilizes a JOIN with 3 or more tables, at 2 OPERATORS (AND, OR, =, IN, BETWEEN, ETC), a GROUP BY clause with an aggregate function, and a HAVING clause.


Group 2: Updating / Deleting Data from a Database
Write a DML statement that UPDATEs a set of rows with a WHERE clause. The values used in the WHERE clause should be a variable.
Write a DML statement that DELETEs a set of rows with a WHERE clause. The values used in the WHERE clause should be a variable.
Write a DML statement that DELETEs rows from a table that another table references. This script will have to also DELETE any records that reference these rows. Both of the DELETE statements need to be wrapped in a single TRANSACTION.

Group 3: Optimizing a Database
Design a NONCLUSTERED INDEX with ONE KEY COLUMN that improves the performance of one of the above queries.
Design a NONCLUSTERED INDEX with TWO KEY COLUMNS that improves the performance of one of the above queries.
Design a NONCLUSTERED INDEX with AT LEAST ONE KEY COLUMN and AT LEAST ONE INCLUDED COLUMN that improves the performance of one of the above queries.


Correct use of Git/Github and commits: I followed the correct steps in the project guidelines to create and name the github repository that would reflect a distinct repository. I then used the proper guidelines to initialize the project and add files using git bash and the command line. I then far exceeded the minimum number of commits needed to pass.

I also named my file a distinct name describing my project.
